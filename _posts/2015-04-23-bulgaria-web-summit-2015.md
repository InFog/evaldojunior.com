So, I attended to my first conference out of Brazil, and as speaker! Wow! It was
a very nice experience and I want to share how it was for me.

I was a speaker for some Brazilian conferences in the past few years and when
I moved to Germany in the end of 2014 I was decided to give it a try and submit
some talks to the European conferences. I got some rejections, of course, and I'm
ok with that, I learned from it ;)

But then this one guy gave me a chance to speak at
[Bulgaria Web Summit 2015](http://bulgariawebsummit.com), and I'm very thankful
for that. Thank you, [Bogomil](http://twitter.com/bogomep)!

I talked to Bogomil in the beginning of January and the conference day seemed to
be very far in the future. But as time passed by I started realizing that it
was really going to happen (and freaked out just a little bit).

As a speaker I have some experience and I'm not afraid of public speaking (I
guess being a teacher for a Brazilian university for four years helped also).
But this was my first time speaking in English.

The plan was to reuse one of my previous presentations (slides) and translate
it into English. But then I realized that I don't really like that style of
slides and presentation anymore. And then I started the presentation notes and
the slides from scratch again. Taking notes was the first thing and after I
finished it I asked for some feedback from [Rafael Dohms](http://twitter.com/rdohms).
Thanks for the help, Rafael!

Notes done, time to make some nice slides. It took me only a few bad slides to
notice that I'm not really good at making visually nice slides. I really wanted
to have good slides for my first presentation in Europe. So I asked for my
wife's help and she guided me to come up with these slides:

<script

    data-ratio="1.33159947984395" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js">
</script>

I really like the result of a few more hours invested in the slides making. If
you are a speaker, try to do the same, the result can be very nice. And after
the talk some people came talk to me and one of the things they said was: I
really liked your slides. So, mission accomplished.

But the thing is that a conference talk is not only about the slides, otherwise
the speakers could just send the slides and everyone could just read them. So I
practiced some times before the talk. I thought the language was going to be a
problem and I asked myself a lot of times if I should let the audience know
upfront that it was my first talk in English. And then I decided not to say it
until the end of the presentation and the questions, if any, after it.

And then I was there, in front of a full room, no more seats left, people
standing up in the back of the room. I was really excited because I was able to
bring that amount of people to my talk. And at the same time I was freaking out
because I was able to bring that amount of people to my talk!

I started my speak, a little bit nervous, I introduced myself and told some joke
about being a Brazilian living in Germany and almost freezing during the
winter, people laugh, and out of a sudden, I was very calm and felling
confident about the talk and the subject again.

The talk was very nice and I had just one or two moments of forgetting some term
in English (or Portuguese, you know, it happens).

After the talk some people asked some nice questions and only then I said that
that was my first talk in English and I heard some people saying "you did great!",
"it was good!". I guess I'm the one really judging me sometimes...

And the most amazing thing happened during the rest of the day: Some people came to
me asking for tips, to congratulate for the talk, etc. Bulgarians are very nice
people indeed :) Thanks for having me and I hope you all enjoyed the conference
and my talk as much as I.

Besides the talk and the conference I met some really nice and interesting people
from different countries. This exchange of experiences is one of the most
amazing things that can happen when people from different countries get together.
If you go to a conference like this, talk to people, introduce yourself, ask
questions, share knowledge, etc. It's very nice.

Oh, and if you like some talk or talks, let the speaker/speakers know it. You know, speakers
are people too, they know some things and they don't know some other things, just
like everyone else. And when you come to a speaker and tell him/her you liked the
talk, you can make the speaker feel that all the effort and time spent for the
talk was a very good invested time and paid off really good.

Next step: Get my talks accepted in other European conferences ;D

See you around!
