I'm speaking at tech conferences since a long time, from small meetups to big
conferences like the PHP Conference Brasil. Speaking at such events is something
I enjoy a lot because I can share what I know with other people and I get the
chance to meet new people and learn from their experiences. Attending a
tech conference is usually a good experience and having the chance to speak at
one is always interesting.

Since I moved from Brazil to Germany, in 2014, I was trying to get my talks
accepted at different European PHP/web development conferences. I was actually
off to a good start speaking at the [Bulgaria Web Summit 2015](/conferences/talks/2015/04/23/bulgaria-web-summit-2015.html),
but after this one I only got rejections and more rejections, I even stopped
trying after a couple years. By the way, if you are also trying to get your
talks accepted at some tech conference, try not to give up, sooner or later one
of your ideas will be accepted.

In the beginning of 2018 I decided it was time to hide my fear of new rejections
away and start applying to tech conferences again. Guess what happened? New
rejections, of course. But not all my tries resulted in rejections, when I
got the email from [iBuildings](https://ibuildings.com/) (Organizers of the
[Dutch PHP Conference](https://www.phpconference.nl/)) saying that my talk was
accepted I felt like hitting the jackpot. My talk was finally selected!

After some moments of excitement I was like "wow this is for real, it is time to
prepare a good presentation and do the best I can". Of course anxiety took over,
but working on one small step at a time I was able to have my presentation
finished a couple weeks before the conference.

I went to Amsterdam a couple days before the conference to enjoy the city with
my with and my 1.5 year old daughter. Best decision ever, as it made me forget
the presentation for a while and just enjoy the good times.

When the conference finally started we had an interesting keynote by
[Kevlin Henney](https://twitter.com/kevlinhenney). And then it was time for my
talk at one of the tracks, the conference had six tracks. I was a bit nervous at
the beginning but I was able to recover my normal pace in a couple minutes. The
presentation was good and I had to answer quite a few questions when it was over.

The good thing about being one of the first ones to present is that you can enjoy
the rest of the conference and not think about your talk anymore or be anxious
about it.

The rest of the conference was quite interesting. I was able to attend some
talks that gave me material to think and to learn new things. By the way, it is
important to praise the organizers for such a smooth conference. Everything
happened on time, the food and coffee were tasty and we even had some Italian
ice cream.

I was also able to meet some colleagues and friends I did not see in a while
and I was lucky enough to win an Elephpant in a raffle from
[Shopware](https://www.shopware.com/).

Overall it was a really good experience and I do recommend anyone who have the
chance to attend the Dutch PHP Conference to do so. This was one of the best
conferences I ever attended.

By the way, my talk was about Postman, you can see the slides below:
