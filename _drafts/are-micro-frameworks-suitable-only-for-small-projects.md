When I first heard about micro-frameworks I thought they were suitable only for small projects,
prototyping and small REST Apis (or other types of Apis).

Well this kind of thinking wasn't my fault. That's how some micro-frameworks were presented to the world.
And still, nowadays, some of them have descriptions that make us think they are really super simple and supposed to
be used only for small or simple projects.

Let's take a look into some of them (Based on a search on [DuckDuckGo](http://ddg.gg) for **php micro framework**).

- [Slim Framework's](http://www.slimframework.com/) page says the framework helps you building **simple** yet powerful applications.
- [Limonade's](https://limonade-php.github.io/) page says it's aimed for rapid web development and **prototyping**.
- [Fat-Free Framework's](http://fatfreeframework.com/home) page says it's **easy** easy to use.

Another interesting note is that most of framework's pages uses the words **simple** and **easy** to describe the framework. Ok, they want to bring in new developers, but maybe **simple** and **easy** are not the right choice of words.

Now, to the big question: Are micro-frameworks really easy to use and aimed mainly to small projects?

Well, I don't think so.

A lot of people misunderstands what the **micro** means for micro-frameworks. It doesn't mean that your projects should me micro or small, it means that the framework will not provide you with almost everything a software project needs. Micro-frameworks are a response for the big full-stack frameworks, that usually brings a lot of libraries, helpers, patterns and structure to help you focus on your problem, not on defining which patterns, libraries, best practices or whatever a project usually needs to be good and maintainable.
