In my [last post about micro-frameworks](http://blog.evaldojunior.com/webdev/microframeworks/discussion/2015/01/08/are-micro-frameworks-suitable-only-for-small-projects.html)
a new question came to the table: Are micro-frameworks a good choice for
beginners?

What some of the options out there claim is that they are super simple to use
and no matter if you are a novice or an experienced developer, they are a good
option for you.

Well, maybe this is not true. I mean, if you just want to prototype something,
ok a micro-framework will be a good option even if you are a begginer, but, if
you want to build something that should grow and probably will be used for some
time, then a micro-framework could not be exactly the best choice for you.

My point is not about the technology you choose being better or worse than
another one, my points are aimed on these topics:

- Team productivity
- Good practices
- Patterns
- External tools

Sometimes we, developers, have a feeling that everything is wrong and if we
move to a new framework, a new language, a new database or a new something else
everything will be ok and there will be no problems anymore. Well, most of the
time we are wrong about it, and with a little bit of patience and love to the
project, things can be fixed. So let's talk about the topics I mentioned.

## Team Productivity

In my point of view a full-stack framework is a tool...
